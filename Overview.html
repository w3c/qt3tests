<h1 style="text-align: center;">XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.* Test Suite</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p class="style1">NOTE: This document is a temporary placeholder for a future document that describes the test suite that will be used to test XQuery 3.*, XPath 3.*, and XSLT 3.* in more detail, more accurately, and more currently.</p>
<p>The XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.* Test Suite (QT3TS) provides a set of metrics for determining
  whether the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30/">W3C XML Query Language, version 3.0</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-30/">W3C XML Path Language, version 3.*</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">W3C XML Stylesheet 
  Language, version 3.*</a> can be implemented interoperably as published. QT3TS will help implementers
  identify possible problems both with the Specifications and with their
  implementations of those Specifications. The test suite is occasionally updated to reflect the current work
  of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">W3C XML Query Working Group</a>
  and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">W3C XSLT Working Group</a>; all
  releases of the QT3TS will be available from this page.</p>
<p>XQuery 3.0 is a superset of XPath 3.0, with the exception of the namespace
axis. As such, this test suite tests all of XPath 3.0. These XPath
3.0 test cases are identified in the test suite catalog.</p>

<p>QT3TS 3.0.1 contains over 22,000 test cases. It contains a catalog that
contains general information on the test suite as well as test descriptions for
each of the test cases included in this release. Test queries and expected
results are contained in &quot;test set&quot; files. All interpretations of these
Recommendations are subject to confirmation by the XML Query Working Group and
the XSLT Working Group.</p>

<p>Implementors are encouraged 1) to write a harness for this test suite and to
test their implementations and 2) to report their results to the XML Query
Working Group. All of these areas are discussed in greater detail below.</p>

<p>This document serves as a first point of information for all interested
parties. A general account of current activities, finalized work, and pointers
to further information is given. In the sections below, you will be able to get
a good view of the status of the QT3TS, and if you are interested in something
in particular you are invited to follow the appropriate link given below.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>The XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.0 Test Suite has not yet been fully developed. It will incorporate all relevant tests from the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/xquery-test-suite/">XML Query 1.0 test suite</a>, as well as many new tests designed to test new features of XQuery 3.0, XPath 3.0, and XSLT 3.0. </p>

This page provides direct access to the files and it contains instructions on
how to use CVS to access these files.</p>

<h1>Running the Test Suite</h1>

<p>We encourage you, the implementors of XQuery and XQueryX, to run these tests
and send us your results. These results will help us exit Candidate
Recommendation (described in the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">Process</a>).</p>

<p>As there is no de jure or de facto API for implementations of XQuery 1.0, we
are not able to provide a test harness to execute these tests. You will have to
write your own test harnesses.</p>

<p>We have provided <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Running%20the%20XML%20Query%20Test%20Suite.html">Guidelines
for Running the XML Query Test Suite</a> to assist you in running these tests.
These guidelines will tell you how the queries may be modified before they are
executed and how to compare your actual results with the expected results that
we have provided. At one time we solicited submissions of test cases from
individuals and organizations that were not already participating in the XML
Query Working Group. You may find a document that we prepared, <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Test%20Submission.html">Guidelines for XML Query Test
Suite Submissions</a>, useful.</p>

<h2>Reporting a Problem</h2>

<p>If you believe that some of the queries or their expected results are
incorrect, then we encourage you to enter bug reports in the public instance of
Bugzilla at W3C, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/">http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/</a>. To
enter a bug report you will need a Bugzilla signon (email address and
password). You can create this singon by following the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/createaccount.cgi">Open a new Bugzilla
account</a> link on the Bugzilla Main Page.</p>

<p>General information on Bugzilla, an open-source bug tracking system, is
available at <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">http://www.bugzilla.org/</a>.
The standard documentation for the version currently being run on the W3C
server is available at <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/">http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/</a>.</p>

<p>To enter a bug report in Bugzilla you will need to log in, choose the action
"New", and then choose the "XML Query Test Suite" product. Please be specific
about the problem that you are reporting. Clearly identify the test case or
test cases that are problematic. If you believe that the expected result is
wrong, then tell us what result you believe is correct. If you believe that
another result for a test case is justified, then please tell us what it is. In
both cases, please cite portions of one or more of the XQuery specifications
that support your position.</p>

<h1>Submission of Test Suite Results</h1>

<p>When you are ready to submit your results to us, we ask that you follow the
guidelines provided in <a
href="Guidelines for Submitting XQTS Test Results.html">Guidelines for
Submitting XML Query Test Suite Results</a>. These guidelines will tell you how
to generate an XML result document that we can use to generate our reports.
They will also tell you how to generate your own report from the XML result
file.</p>

<p>If you have indicated that you wish your results to be displayed as
&ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo;, then please send them to the XML Query WG Team
Contact, <a href="mailto:liam@w3.org">Liam Quin</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:w3t-archive@w3.org">w3t-archive@w3.org</a>. Otherwise, please send
them to the XML Query WG co-chair, <a
href="mailto:andrew.eisenberg@us.ibm.com">Andrew Eisenberg</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:www-archive@w3.org">www-archive@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage you to send us results early, and then to send us updates as
the XQTS progresses and as your implementation progresses.</p>
-->

<!--
<h1>Submission of Test Cases</h1>

<p>We welcome submissions of test cases from individuals and organizations
that are not already participating in the XML Query Working Group. We
encourage you to look at <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Test%20Submission.html">Guidelines for XML Query
Test Suite Submissions</a> so that the test cases that you submit can be
added easily to our test suite.</p>

<p>If you would like to submit test cases, then you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register for a W3C account. You can request one through the <a
    href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/Public">Public Access Request
    Form</a>.</li>
  <li>Submit your test cases using <a>Grant II: Grant of License for
    Contributed Test Cases Published Outside a W3C Recommendation</a>. This
    license grant, for non-Participant test case Contributors, is described
    in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html">Policies for
    Contribution of Test Cases to W3C</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XML Query Working Group and XSL Working Group will, at their sole
discretion, determine what tests are incorporated in the test suite.</p>
